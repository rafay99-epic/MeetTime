## üöÄ Getting Started (For Developers)

This section is for developers who want to build, modify, and contribute to MeetTime. If you just want to use the app, see the Download APK section above.

### Prerequisites

- **Flutter:** Version 3.16 or later is required. You can download and install Flutter from the official website: [https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install)
- **Dart SDK:** The Dart SDK is bundled with Flutter, so no separate installation is needed.
- **Android SDK:** Ensure you have the Android SDK installed and configured. This usually comes with Android Studio.
- **Android Studio or Visual Studio Code:** These are the recommended IDEs for Flutter development.
- **Java Development Kit (JDK):** Version 17 or higher is recommended. Download and install it from [https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk17-downloads.html](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk17-downloads.html) or use an alternative like OpenJDK.
- **Internet Access:** Required for downloading dependencies and using the AI chatbot feature.

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rafay99-epic/MeetTime.git
   cd MeetTime
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**

   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

   This command downloads all the necessary packages and dependencies for the project.

3. **Connect a Device or Emulator:**

   - **Android Emulator:** If you don't have a physical Android device, you'll need to set up an Android emulator using Android Studio.
   - **Physical Device:** Enable developer options and USB debugging on your Android device, then connect it to your computer. You may need to install USB drivers specific to your device.

4. **Run the App:**
   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```
   This command builds the app and installs it on your connected device or emulator. You should see the MeetTime app running on your device.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### üîê Google Gemini Chatbot Integration (Advanced)

To enhance the AI assistant functionality, you can integrate your own Google Gemini API key. This is optional, but recommended for a better experience and fewer limitations.

1.  **Obtain an API Key from Google AI Studio:**

    - Go to [https://aistudio.google.com/](https://aistudio.google.com/) and create an account or log in.
    - Follow the instructions to create a new API key. Make sure to keep your API key secure.

2.  **Add Your API Key to MeetTime:**

    - Open the MeetTime app on your device or emulator.
    - Navigate to the `Settings` screen (look for an icon that represents settings, like a gear or cog).
    - Locate the "OpenAI API Key" or "Chatbot API Key" field.
    - Paste the API key you obtained from Google AI Studio into the field.
    - Save the settings. The app may need to restart for the changes to take effect.

**Important Security Note:** Never hardcode your API key directly into the app's source code. This is a security risk. MeetTime should store the API key securely (e.g., in local storage or encrypted preferences) after the user enters it.
